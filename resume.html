                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've spent over 20 years poking and prodding 
                        into any realm of technology I could begin to 
                        wrap my brain around.  I've designed new, and reworked existing small ISPs.
                        I've designed web pages. I've written apps. I've designed and implemented all 
                        sorts of networks.  I've done corporate OS rollouts, and Ive handled more support 
                        tickets and support calls than any sane man should ever see.  
                        I've even been on the receiving end of multiple NORAD Tracks Santa phone calls. 
                        </p><p>
                        I've never specialized in any one thing mainly because I don't think
                        I could stand to be stuck in one thing.  I pride myself on the ability 
                        to bring my broad spectrum of knowledge up against nearly any tech problem.

                        <p>SixBit is a piece of desktop software designed to 
                            help small sellers get their inventory online quickly
                            and help handle all aspects of the e-Commerce process.
                            While here I brought my troubleshooting skills to bear on issues with the software
                            and implemented several tools to help.  I've learned a lot
                            about SQL while on this job.  I designed and implemented a VOIP 
                            phone system using Asterisk which cut costs considerably. I also
                            designed and implemented the network here.  My primary focus
                            however is customer support.  I enjoy being able to wear many hats
                            in the workplace and I get to do that in abundance at SixBit.

                            occasional request to solve a computing problem. I managed the VPN access lists,
                            handled the 911 center's Computer Aided Dispatch system and maintained several 
                            SQL Server instances.  The county was on an old DEC VAX system for much of my time 
                            there and we handed off a lot of that processing to different vendors during my time there.  
                            There were still reports and backups to run on the old system though. Learned a lot 
                            about troubleshooting in an undocumented environment.

                            maintaining and verifying backup sets for Canberra industries (cool place with a lot of neat hardware)
                            and the next week I'd be doing a Windows 2000 rollout for an insurance company.  Just your basic "spare" IT guy.

                            At OCI I was tasked to do things I didn't know if I'd be able to do:  build a dial-up ISP,
                            re-work an existing cable ISP to allow the owners to get out from under a $1000 a month service contract,
                            customize PHPNuke CMS websites, integrate ASP-based billing into our Active Directory, set up
                            and administer an Exchange server... the list goes on and on.  Gave me a good idea of what's 
                            possible if I put my mind to it.  Can't say I got any of those things done quickly, but I did get them done.
                            Unfortunately, OCI went under in the summer of 2004 due to poor management, but the tech side under
                            me was doing well at least.

                            So my official title was "Customer Engineer" but that always sounded shady to me, 
                            so I labelled it "Field Technician" since that's what I was.  This was my second job out of the military,
                            the first being a short stint on the United Parcel Service help desk in Pittsburgh.  At Maintech I 
                            went to customer locations and swapped out hardware.  It wasn't much but it paid well.  I learned 
                            that there wasn't much of a future in hardware troubleshooting and break/fix as it was clearly a 
                            dying field that was beginning to become marginalized even in 2001.

                            I can credit the US Air Force for my love of learning.  There I learned basic electronics 
                            and how to read schematics. As I went along we got re-purposed into more generalized
                            fields, as we had been the last component-level repair facility in the Air Force. Working on old 
                            NOVA 800 and 1200s gave you a good grounding in what a computer system is and it was a great
                            base to build from.  I learned a lot of my troublethooting theory there as well.  I got to go to 
                            classes on older systems that were actually past their prime.  Since there was a mission involved 
                            that required these systems to remain operational DEC, IBM, and Loral pulled folks out of
                            retirement and off of other projects to come in and teach us IBM 3090s, VAX hardware systems and
                            Silicon Graphics Indigo and Crimson systems along with all of the peripherals involved in keeping 
                            the SPADOC system (Space Defense Operations Center) up and running.
