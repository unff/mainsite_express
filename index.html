                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've spent over 20 years poking and prodding 
                        into any realm of technology I could begin to 
                        wrap my brain around.  I've designed new and reworked existing small ISPs,
                        I've designed web pages,
                        I've written apps, I've designed and implemented all sorts of networks, 
                        I've done corporate OS rollouts, and Ive handled more support tickets and
                        support calls than any sane man should ever see.  
                        I've even been on the receiving 
                        end of more than one NORAD Tracks Santa phone call. 
                        </p><p>
                        I've never specialized in any one thing mainly because I don't think
                        I could stand to be stuck in one thing.  I pride myself on the ability 
                        to bring my broad spectrum of knowledge up against nearly any tech problem.

                        <p>SixBit is a piece of desktop software designed to 
                            help small sellers get their inventory online quickly
                            and help handle all aspects of the e-Commerce process.
                            While here I brought my troubleshooting skills to bear
                            and implemented several tools to help.  I've learned a lot
                            about SQL while on this job.  I designed and implemented a VOIP 
                            phone system using Asterisk which cut costs considerably. I also
                            designed and implemented the network here.  My primary focus
                            however is customer support.  I enjoy being able to wear many hats
                            in the workplace and I got to do that in abundance at SixBit.

                            be routed through the Comcast or Dish team at support.com.  It
                            was nice to work from home (can't beat the commute) and I got to help

                            At the county IT office I did a lot of break/fix and the 
                            occasional request to solve a computing problem. I managed the VPN access lists,
                            handled the 911 center's Computer Aided Dispatch system and maintained several 
                            SQL Server instances.  The county was on an old DEC VAX system for much of my time 
                            there and we handed off a lot of that processing to different vendors.  There were still
                            reports and backups to run on the old system though. Learned a lot about troubleshooting
                            in an undocumented environment.

                            various IT roles for a multitude of different customers.  One week it would be
                            maintaining and verifying backup sets for Canberra industries (cool place with a lot of neat hardware)
                            and the next week I'd be doing a Windows 2000 rollout for an insurance company.  Just your basic "spare" IT guy. 
                            Learned a lot about how to be flexible and how to maintain expectations in a new environment.
