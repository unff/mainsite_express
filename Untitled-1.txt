                        I've spent over 20 years poking and prodding 
                        into any realm of technology I could begin to 
                        wrap my brain around.  I've designed new and reworked existing ISPs,
                        I've designed web pages,
                        I've written apps, I've designed and implemented all sorts of networks, 
                        I've done corporate OS rollouts, and Ive handled more support tickets and
                        support calls than any sane man should ever see.  
                        I've even been on the receiving 
                        end of more than one NORAD Tracks Santa phone call.

                        I've never specialized in any one thing mainly because I don't think
                        I could stand to be stuck in one thing.  I pride myself on the ability 
                        to bring my broad spectrum of knowledge up against nearly any tech problem.
